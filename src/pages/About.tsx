      <Title>About me</Title>
      <Text>
        I grew up in Dubnica nad VÃ¡hom - a town in the west of Slovakia. During my
        later years in middle school, I discovered my passion for video editing,
        which quickly turned into a hobby. Motivated by this newfound interest, I
        took the initiative to create my own YouTube channel, where I poured my
        creativity and skills into crafting engaging and entertaining content.

        I have several years of experience collaborating with content creators and
        thriving in self-employment. Over those years, I have honed my skills using
        industry-leading software like Photoshop and Premiere, alongside various
        other specialized solutions. My achievements include managing and growing two
        successful YouTube channels, where I consistently deliver engaging and
        high-quality content to my audience.

        With a strong background as a highlight video editor, I have developed a
        solid foundation in storytelling and visual aesthetics. These skills are
        invaluable assets that I can leverage to excel in the fields of
        cinematography and graphic design. I am enthusiastic about delving deeper
        into these disciplines, pushing the boundaries of my creativity, and
        consistently delivering exceptional outcomes.
