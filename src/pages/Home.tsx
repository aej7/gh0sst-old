        Greetings, my name is Lukas, also known as Gh0ssT. I am a highly skilled
        video editor with several years of experience. I excel at creating
        captivating video highlights that showcase the best moments from various
        Twitch content creators like Resttpowered, Opat04, Grinder, 2SekundovyMato,
        and more. In addition to my expertise in video editing, I also possess a
        flair for graphic design. This additional skill allows me to enhance the
        visual aesthetics of my work, resulting in a polished and professional final
        product.
